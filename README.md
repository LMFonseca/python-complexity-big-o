# python-complexity-big-o
This repository has the solution for the following problem: "Given an array of integer and a target,
return the index of a pair where the sum of this pair is equaled to the target.  Return when first pairs were found".
It was implemented and compared the following approaches:
- Brute force - Complexity = O(n^2)
- Sort the array - Complexity = O(n log n) * n
- Using the complement - Complexity: O(n)
